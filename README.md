# toddlerLearning
A simple letter guessing game that shows uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, kindergarten sight words and basic three and four letter words for early readers.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Use the dropdown to choose the category:

- **Lowercase/Uppercase** – random letters
- **Numbers** – counts from 1 to 100
- **Kindergarten sight words** – common sight words
- **3-letter words** – simple words like `cat`, `dog`, etc.
- **4-letter words** – slightly longer words like `tree` or `book`

Click **Next** or press the **Right Arrow** key to show a new entry each time.

The layout uses responsive styles so it works well on both desktop and mobile screens.

## Memory Match Game

The repository also includes a simple matching game. Open `memory.html` in a browser to play.

- A 2 x 3 grid of hidden shapes is presented.
- Click on two cells to reveal their shapes.
- If the shapes match they disappear; otherwise they are hidden again after a short delay.
- When all matches are found, a star rating appears (5 stars for a perfect game and at least one star otherwise) and a short celebratory melody plays for about five seconds.



## +3 Flash Card Game

Open `addition.html` in a browser for a math practice game focused on **+3** facts.

- Questions come from `1+3` through `10+3`.
- Each game asks 5 random questions.
- The child says the answer out loud, clicks the card to flip, and then marks whether they got it right.
- A 0 to 5 star score appears at the end of each 5-question round.
- If the score is 4 or 5 stars, a celebratory sound plays.
