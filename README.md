A simple letter guessing game that shows uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, kindergarten sight words and basic three and four letter words for early readers.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Use the dropdown to choose the category:

- **Lowercase/Uppercase** – random letters
- **Numbers** – counts from 1 to 100
- **Kindergarten sight words** – common sight words
- **3-letter words** – simple words like `cat`, `dog`, etc.
- **4-letter words** – slightly longer words like `tree` or `book`

Click **Next** or press the **Right Arrow** key to show a new entry each time.

The layout uses responsive styles so it works well on both desktop and mobile screens.

## Memory Match Game

The repository also includes a simple matching game. Open `memory.html` in a browser to play.

- A 2 x 3 grid of hidden shapes is presented.
- Click on two cells to reveal their shapes.
- If the shapes match they disappear; otherwise they are hidden again after a short delay.
